            <h2>Welcome to my page!</h2>
            <p> With over 7 years of experience as a Technical Program Manager and Agile Coach, I specialize in scaling processes across teams, optimizing product development, and driving cross-functional alignment to deliver high-impact results. I have guided global tech teams across SaaS and financial services, from startups to Fortune 200 companies, by implementing Scrum, Kanban, and Lean methodologies. My expertise includes setting up Product Operations, establishing Software Development Lifecycles (SDLCs), and advocating for engineering best practices to improve efficiency and collaboration.</p>
            <p>Having lived in 8 countries, I bring a global perspective and adaptability to my work.  </p>
             <p> Outside of work, I enjoy studying languages, urban exploration, and spending time with my wife and 80-pound goldendoodle.</p>
            <p> <strong>Based in the greater New York Area, I am open to relocation to the Bay Area for the right opportunity.<strong> </p>
