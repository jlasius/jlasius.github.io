            <h2>Welcome to my page!</h2>
            <p> With over 7 years of experience in Technology Program Management, I specialize in scaling processes across teams, empowering product organizations, and driving cross-functional alignment to deliver high-impact results. Throughout my career, I have guided global tech teams within SaaS products and financial services across startups to Fortune 200 companies, set up Product Operations, established Software Development Lifecycles (SDLCs), and served as an advocate for sustainable engineering practices.</p>
            <p>Having lived in 8 countries, I bring a global perspective and adaptability to my work.  </p>
             <p> Outside of work, I enjoy studying languages, urban exploration, and spending time with my wife and 80-pound goldendoodle.</p>
            <p> <strong>Based in the greater New York Area, I am open to relocation to the Bay Area for the right opportunity.<strong> </p>
